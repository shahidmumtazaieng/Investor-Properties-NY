## How the Offer System Works

1. **Unauthenticated Users**: When clicking "Make Offer" button on a property detail page, users are automatically redirected to the investor authentication page (`/auth/investor`)

2. **Authenticated Users**: After logging in, users can submit offers through the offer form which:
   - Validates all required fields
   - Submits offer data to the database
   - Associates the offer with the authenticated investor
   - Provides confirmation of successful submission

3. **Admin Review**: Property offers are stored in the database and can be reviewed by administrators through the admin panel

## Next Steps for Usage

### For Administration
1. Access the admin panel at `/admin/properties`
2. Create, edit, and manage property listings
3. Review and respond to property offers
4. Monitor property performance and engagement

### For Public Users
1. Visit `/properties` to browse listings
2. View individual property details at `/properties/:id`
3. Use search and filtering options
4. Authenticate to submit offers on properties
