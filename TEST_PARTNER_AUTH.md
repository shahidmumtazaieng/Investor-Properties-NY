# Partner Seller Authentication - Database Integration Verification

## Overview
This document confirms that the partner seller authentication system is fully implemented with real database integration.

## Verification Results

### 1. Database Repository Methods
All required partner methods are implemented in the database repository:
- `getPartnerById(id)` - Fetch partner by ID
- `getPartnerByUsername(username)` - Fetch partner by username
- `getPartnerByEmail(email)` - Fetch partner by email
- `createPartner(partnerData)` - Create new partner
- `updatePartner(id, partnerData)` - Update existing partner
- `authenticatePartner(username, password)` - Authenticate partner credentials

### 2. Database Integration
- All partner data is stored in PostgreSQL database
- Drizzle ORM is used for all database operations
- Schema includes all required fields:
  - id (UUID)
  - username (unique)
  - password (hashed)
  - email (unique)
  - firstName
  - lastName
  - company
  - phone
  - isActive (boolean)
  - approvalStatus (pending/approved/rejected)
  - approvedAt (timestamp)
  - approvedBy (reference)
  - rejectionReason
  - emailVerified (boolean)
  - emailVerificationToken
  - emailVerificationSentAt
  - emailVerifiedAt
  - phoneVerified (boolean)
  - phoneVerificationCode
  - phoneVerificationSentAt
  - phoneVerifiedAt
  - passwordResetToken
  - passwordResetExpires
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt

### 3. Authentication Flow
1. **Registration Process**
   - Partners can register with all required fields
   - Password hashing using bcrypt
   - Unique username and email validation
   - Account approval workflow
   - Email and phone verification tokens

2. **Login Process**
   - Username and password authentication
   - bcrypt password comparison
   - Account status checks (isActive and approvalStatus)
   - JWT token generation

### 4. Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token-based sessions
- Account approval workflow
- Active status validation
- Unique username/email constraints

### 5. API Endpoints
- POST /api/auth/partners/register
- POST /api/auth/partners/login

## Test Scripts
Two test scripts have been created to verify the implementation:
1. `test-partner-auth.js` - CommonJS version
2. `verify-partner-auth.mjs` - ES Modules version

## Conclusion
The partner seller authentication system is fully implemented with real database integration. All methods are properly connected to the PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM, and all security features are in place.
